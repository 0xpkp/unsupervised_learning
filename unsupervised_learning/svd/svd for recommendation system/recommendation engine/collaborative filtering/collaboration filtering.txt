in this type of recommendation system, the item/product is recommended based on the users behaviour. for example, if 'user1' watched 'mov1', mov2' and 'mov3' movies and 'user2' also watched 'mov1', mov2' and 'mov3' and when you watch movies 'mov1' and mov2' , you will be recommended with 'mov3'. here, the metadata of the product doesn't matter as it maps the similarity between the users and groups then where the recommendation for a group is similar.
